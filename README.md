Kaggle provided the data that was used for our data. The dataset consists of the scoring percentages, names, draft years, height, weight, all star games and many more characteristic of more than a thousand basketball players. The data collected was gotten to analyse the starting years of the nba to present day. The purpose of the dataset was to know the worst all star player or the tallest best player. We believe this project would be fun and also very curious to see who the statistics favour.
